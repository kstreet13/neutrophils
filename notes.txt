----------
Time series bulk RNAseq
4 time points
Inflammation after trauma
In neutrophil tissue compartment

Did a similar study in septic shock
3 timepoints

Looking at gene modules related to multi-organ failure
See if they're similar to septic shock

Planning R21 for October

Bulk vs. scRNAseq
How to compare? Make sense of new in sense of old

Neutrophils are not as well characterized in the literature
Can make networks weird

Lot of trauma data out there
Might use public data for comparison

----------
Cobb paper
gene expression in septic shock
systemic inflammation
data collection challenges in trauma
there are different subtypes
7 patients with vasoplegic syndrome
12 with septic shock
8 with neither(?)
bulk neutrophils, RNAseq
RPKM
samps cluster by timepoint (do PCA)
change definition of "recovering" genes

Fig 2 adds in patients with vasoplegic syndrome
25-50% w/bypass surgery get it, half do badly

flowchart: find most interesting genes(?)
excluded genes only changing between 2nd two timepoints

sever vaso synd looks like septic shock



analysis has been going on 4 years
UCLA person makes figures, doesn't have bandwidth or biostats training


first:
explain GEO2R (1-2 sentence)
names of datasets we've downloaded

clustering (old way and my way)
PCA

Phil Scumpia from UCLA

Want mechanistic GO terms from DE genes between groups

They have a second dataset from a more controlled setting, two types of response

Project has been going on >4 years
Initially, sub-types of neutrophils were not well known

New papers do scRNAseq on neutrophils, found immature, netosis(?), MMP8+ subgroups

Genes associated with these subgroups may overlap with genes relevant to clinical outcome
Could get more mechanism in the story

Similarity between sepsis and VS

Generate 3D pca plot, send loadings
Check re-run PCA with genes based on variance

Do PCA with subsets:
1. Surgical controls vs healthy controls (all timepoints)
2. Post-bypass timepoints (B and C) all patients ?



2024-02-02
----------
X - clustering
X - DE between MMP8+ (SS1-6) and MMP8- (SS7-12)
X - DE between clusters


2024-02-12
----------
send cluster heatmap


2024-04-09
----------
DE for patients with normal surgical response
To check against previous (rpkm-based) results
SC 3 timepoints DE signatures
All 3 pairwise comparisons


2024-04-30
----------
send dendrograms


2024-05-07
----------
Anaar looking at my DE lists, trying to compare to hers
Re-created her list for surgical controls, looking for overlap
Email Morgan about payment
*** generate DE list Anaar's way (at least 1.5x change in every pair of samples) and compare


2024-05-15
----------
Our DE lists don't overlap very well


2024-05-21
----------
Send Anaar all 12 DE lists


2024-05-28
----------
generate same DE lists for vasoplegic patients
within Mild (MVS): do similar timepoint analysis
same within Severe (SVS)
9 groups of genes (up/down/same between consecutive timepoints)


2024-06-26
----------
mmp8+ list doesn't include mmp8
re-do MMP8+, MMP8-, and SS lists
I swapped MMP8+ and - labels,
are we sure SS6 is MMP8-? It's a big outlier


2024-07-30
----------
trying to reconcile lists
Anaar - some might still be mislabeled?
send list of imputed genes in FPKM data for sample 1 (EC1)
RPKM data MMP8 doesn't match counts data
re-generate DE lists - I didn't change all instances of "clfc" to "cfc"


2024-08-06
----------
Anaar checked lists, they look good
next steps: remaking figures with new lists


2024-08-29
----------
Anaar, Wendy
Wendy suggesting Jeremy Yu for our grant
will set up meeting for me +/- Anaar


2024-08-29
----------
Anaar, Jeremy
introduction to previous/ongoing work and R-21 project


2024-10-01
----------
Anaar, Jeremy
what are the main scientific questions for the datasets Jeremy is compiling?
discuss available variables (metadata) in each

first dataset: want patients with severe blunt trauma and NOT those with severe burns. 
Take note of timepoint. 
Some went on to have multiple organ failure: track that, if possible
Exclude controls exposed to endotoxin, keep healthy controls

second dataset: GSE40012
want patients w/ bacterial pneumonia but without any form of virus (viral pneumonia, influenza, etc.)
keep all timepoints, keep track
plan for gender + age adjustment, but won't be first question

third dataset: GSE20346
include bacterial pneumonia (n=6?), note sample day (timepoint)
exclude overlap with previous dataset
exclude those with influenza and influenza vaccine recipients

Main question: Do we see the signature (that we defined) in the groups of patients where we expect it (and not see it where we don't expect it)?

4th dataset: GSE65682
expect some patients to have signature (or not) based on source of infection
exclude anybody with no source listed
Jeremy: might not have source info

5th dataset: GSE33341
exclude mice
this one is complicated
want patients that "only had bacterimia", not "another source"
find info on source of infection

6th dataset: GSE60244
keep those with bacterial pneumonia, exclude viral and viral+bacterial pneumonia
include healthy controls

Jeremy will send spreadsheet with variables, Anaar will annotate with which ones to keep
Ping if no response by Monday



2024-10-17
----------
One HC patient was not actually healthy (patient 9)
How much effort would it be to exclude them / re-run analysis?
Anaar has list of figures needed for paper



2024-10-24
----------
"Flow chart of which genes to compare to SVS and MMP8:  Those that are different at the C timepoint compared to the A timepoint, because the MMP8 signature is not dynamic."
Genes DE between A and C
Genes have to be in same category (early, late, recovery, continuous)
Give Jeremy the trauma data from Partek flow, get it together, do clustering


2024-12-10
----------
keep cranking through list
B/W versions of SC gene pattern plots (line and bar)
MMP8 DE lists


2024-12-17
----------
keep cranking through list
MMP8 DE lists


2025-01-07
----------
Jeremy analysis update, no big differences between mild and severe injury
Anaar presenting to Cobb and Kushairy(?)
encoded each patient during each time window as either 1 (didn't receive additional immune insult) or 2 (did)
want to control for lactate (rather than injury severity score)
color code PCA plot by bin in previous time window


2025-01-14
----------
Justin Wang, medical student collecting samples


2025-01-21
----------
Anaar just met with Dr. Cobb
Jeremy's "delta PCA" plot doesn't show much
Jeremy didn't find any DE genes at all in any timepoint
Anaar went through R21 stuff


2025-01-28
----------
Jeremy: new delta PCA plot w/averages
doing DE by timepoint within bins -> nothing is significant


2025-01-28
----------
Jeremy: random intercept model was overfitting, singular for ~25% of genes
sticking with bin-specific 2 timepoint models
Anaar preparing abstract
ran DE in Excel: all samples in a timepoint vs (3) healthy controls
pathways make biological sense
want a line plot showing patterns - up, down, recovery
can run clustering on gene dynamics (fold changes)
Anaar will send count data soon


2025-02-11
----------
updates from my figures showing gene expression patterns over time
hard to compare timepoints to 3 healthy controls AND correct for lactate


2025-09-02
----------
Anaar, James, Joseph Cuschieri, Perren Cobb
overview of secondary analysis project
practices may have changed since first paper ("Genomic Storm"), later timepoints may look different
start by using "our list" of genes, see how samples separate by these genes
start with just time 0 samples, see if we see signal of "pro-invasive" signature
"normalize" all datasets from 0-100 (uniform), add zeros for missing genes, combine and cluster


2025-09-23
----------
is it possible that some of the genes we call DE are very lowly expressed?
to do: check the average CPM for DE genes
