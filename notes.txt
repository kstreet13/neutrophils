----------
Time series bulk RNAseq
4 time points
Inflammation after trauma
In neutrophil tissue compartment

Did a similar study in septic shock
3 timepoints

Looking at gene modules related to multi-organ failure
See if they're similar to septic shock

Planning R21 for October

Bulk vs. scRNAseq
How to compare? Make sense of new in sense of old

Neutrophils are not as well characterized in the literature
Can make networks weird

Lot of trauma data out there
Might use public data for comparison

----------
Cobb paper
gene expression in septic shock
systemic inflammation
data collection challenges in trauma
there are different subtypes
7 patients with vasoplegic syndrome
12 with septic shock
8 with neither(?)
bulk neutrophils, RNAseq
RPKM
samps cluster by timepoint (do PCA)
change definition of "recovering" genes

Fig 2 adds in patients with vasoplegic syndrome
25-50% w/bypass surgery get it, half do badly

flowchart: find most interesting genes(?)
excluded genes only changing between 2nd two timepoints

sever vaso synd looks like septic shock



analysis has been going on 4 years
UCLA person makes figures, doesn't have bandwidth or biostats training


first:
explain GEO2R (1-2 sentence)
names of datasets we've downloaded

clustering (old way and my way)
PCA

Phil Scumpia from UCLA

Want mechanistic GO terms from DE genes between groups

They have a second dataset from a more controlled setting, two types of response

Project has been going on >4 years
Initially, sub-types of neutrophils were not well known

New papers do scRNAseq on neutrophils, found immature, netosis(?), MMP8+ subgroups

Genes associated with these subgroups may overlap with genes relevant to clinical outcome
Could get more mechanism in the story

Similarity between sepsis and VS

Generate 3D pca plot, send loadings
Check re-run PCA with genes based on variance

Do PCA with subsets:
1. Surgical controls vs healthy controls (all timepoints)
2. Post-bypass timepoints (B and C) all patients ?





so far: ~7 hours
