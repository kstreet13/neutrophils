gene expression in septic shock
systemic inflammation
data collection challenges in trauma
there are different subtypes
7 patients with vasoplegic syndrome
12 with septic shock
8 with neither(?)
bulk neutrophils, RNAseq
RPKM
samps cluster by timepoint (do PCA)
change definition of "recovering" genes

Fig 2 adds in patients with vasoplegic syndrome
25-50% w/bypass surgery get it, half do badly

flowchart: find most interesting genes(?)
excluded genes only changing between 2nd two timepoints

sever vaso synd looks like septic shock



analysis has been going on 4 years
UCLA person makes figures, doesn't have bandwidth or biostats training


first:
explain GEO2R (1-2 sentence)
names of datasets we've downloaded

clustering (old way and my way)
PCA


so far: ~2 hours
